Main inspirations:
------------------
- Geometry Wars
- Super Crate Box

Limitations:
------------
- Single screen
- One life
- Score chaser
- Very simple enemies, no attack animation

Power-ups:
----------
- Twisted Mirror (makes a copy of the player, shoots/moves in the opposite direction)
   * Maybe, if one of the clone days, you keep playing as the other one and don't die right away?
   * Or your mirror clone would be just "transparent" to attacks for some period of time?
- Invisibility Cloak (you can pass through enemies and keep shooting)
- Berserk (like in Doom, you punch poor fucks with a single hit to death with fists)
   * Would be cool to make the player completely red with glowing yellow eyes and smoke coming out of his ears or something
- Ice Boots (leave a trail of icecyles damaging/slowing enemies)
   * Don't seem to be very useful compared to other power-ups
- Stomp Boots

Weapons:
--------
- Repeater crossbow (rapid fire, but lower damage)
  * Maybe it shoots green (poison/acid arrows)
  * Alternative fire cluster shot? aka flak cannon?
- Throwing knives/axe (slower, but higher damage)
- Magic Wand (shooting fireballs, explosion AOE)
  * Instead of a wand, maybe it's a "mini cannon"?
- Hammer? (high damage to enemies in front, others are stunned/slowed down)
- Fire bomb (AOE, low damage and enemies are slowed down)
- Spike trap (like a mine, shoots spikes up, kills a single enemy, up to N times before destruction)
- Throws hammer/axe? Travels in one direction and then back? So basically a boomerang!
  * The more enemies you hit going forward, the more damage it will deal flying backward?
  * Maybe it will fly offscreen and come to you from the other side? As if it traveled across the whole world lol.
  * Maybe it's a boomerang?
  * Or a shield?!
- Captain america style shield?

Weapon purpose:
---------------
- Pistol: default weapon, average fire rate, good damage
- Machine gun: fast fire rate, good damage
- Bazooka: slow fire rate, instant kill, area of effect
- Dual pistols: average fire rate, good damage, shoots in both directions
- Revolver: slower fire rate, great damage
- Flamethrower: lasting area of effect, crowd control
- Mines: instant kill, crowd control
- Laser rifle: great damage, penetration

Enemies:
--------
- Bouncing enemy which goes up and down?
- Ghost which flies through solids?
- Skeleton which rushes at you? (very brittle, but very fast)
- Spider?

TODO:
-----
- Experiment with arrow stretching as it travels, does it give a better impact feeling?
- Axe sprite is too big, we need a different sprite for it!
    - In general axe is a shit weapon.
    - Instead of traveling back, maybe we could throw axe multiple times like a projectile which penetrates multiple enemies?
- Console could be a GameScreen (with IsPopup = true), which would prevent input to other screens.
- Fire pit particle effects.
- AI on/off command would be very useful.
- Console cursor movement would be useful if it's not too hard to implement.
- Animation curve functions from the book
- Implement audio manager:
    * Avoid playing same sound at the same time (which gets very loud)
    * Central place to control volume
- (OPTIONAL) Refactor enemy movement, it's a copy paste code 3 times over.
     It will take longer to think about and implement properly, but I don't think the benefits will be justified.
     It's not that hard to understand/navigate the code and change the values as needed. Probably will not work on.	
- Enemy death animation/effect etc.
- Avoid spawning chest above the pit.
- Adding way more enemies makes the games more fun.
- Camera zoon with mouse for debugging purposes.
- Weapon bob.
