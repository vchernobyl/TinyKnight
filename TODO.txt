Main inspirations:
------------------
- Geometry Wars
- Super Crate Box

Limitations:
------------
- Single screen
- One life
- Score chaser
- Very simple enemies, no attack animation

Design:
-------
- Enemies fall from the top, and try to reach the bottom of the level
- Once they reach "The Pit", we have multiple possibilities:
  * Game over
  * Enemy respawns stronger
  * Enemies start spawning more frequently
  * Maybe you get some powerup when killing respawned enemy?
  * Maybe you can jump yourself in the pit for risk/reward type of situation?
  * Maybe you collect the coins and throw them into pit to get something?
- Need to think about how to earn the power-ups
  * Randomly on enemy kill
  * Spawned at some location at certain interval? (like in Unreal Tournament)

Idea #1: As you kill enemies you collect their souls/coins or whatever. The more coins you have the better weapons/powerups you get?
Should incentivise the player not to jump too early and to save coins.

Idea #2: Enemies are trying to destroy the door at the bottom. Once destroyed - game over.

Idea #3: What if you are actually invincible from enemy damage, and only get stunned or something? The real way to lose is if enemy
reached the pit.

The more enemies fall into the pit the harder the game should become. How do we increase the difficulty?
- Maybe level shrinks or something? 
- Hero weapon breaks?

Power-ups:
----------
- Twisted Mirror (makes a copy of the player, shoots/moves in the opposite direction)
   * Maybe, if one of the clone days, you keep playing as the other one and don't die right away?
   * Or your mirror clone would be just "transparent" to attacks for some period of time?
- Invisibility Cloak (you can pass through enemies and keep shooting)
- Berserk (like in Doom, you punch poor fucks with a single hit to death with fists)
   * Would be cool to make the player completely red with glowing yellow eyes and smoke coming out of his ears or something
- Ice Boots (leave a trail of icecyles damaging/slowing enemies)
   * Don't seem to be very useful compared to other power-ups
- Stomp Boots

Weapons:
--------
- Repeater crossbow (rapid fire, but lower damage)
  * Maybe it shoots green (poison/acid arrows)
  * Alternative fire cluster shot? aka flak cannon?
- Throwing knives/axe (slower, but higher damage)
- Magic Wand (shooting fireballs, explosion AOE)
  * Instead of a wand, maybe it's a "mini cannon"?
- Hammer? (high damage to enemies in front, others are stunned/slowed down)
- Fire bomb (AOE, low damage and enemies are slowed down)
- Spike trap (like a mine, shoots spikes up, kills a single enemy, up to N times before destruction)
- Throws hammer/axe? Travels in one direction and then back? So basically a boomerang!
  * The more enemies you hit going forward, the more damage it will deal flying backward?
  * Maybe it will fly offscreen and come to you from the other side? As if it traveled across the whole world lol.
  * Maybe it's a boomerang?
  * Or a shield?!
- Captain america style shield?

Enemies:
--------
- Bouncing enemy which goes up and down?
- Ghost which flies through solids?
- Skeleton which rushes at you? (very brittle, but very fast)
- Spider?

TODO:
-----
- Experiment with arrow stretching as it travels, does it give a better impact feeling?
- Collision masks
- Pinky looking charging monster
- Greatly simplify current screen manager. For some reason it calls Update on the screen before
  calling HandleInput. It also gives us functionality that we don't need, including possibility
  for multiplayer input etc.
- Axe sprite is too big, we need a different sprite for it!
- Console could be a GameScreen (with IsPopup = true), which would prevent input to other screens.
- Fix arrow not having correct direction on first frame when shooting left.
- Fix weird stretching when jumping.
- Fix axe position in hero hands.
