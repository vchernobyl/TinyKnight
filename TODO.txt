Main inspirations:
------------------
- Geometry Wars
- Super Crate Box

Limitations:
------------
- Single screen
- One life
- Score chaser
- Very simple enemies, no attack animation

Design:
-------
- Enemies fall from the top, and try to reach the bottom of the level
- Once they reach "The Pit", we have multiple possibilities:
  * Game over
  * Enemy respawns stronger
  * Enemies start spawning more frequently
  * Maybe you get some powerup when killing respawned enemy?
  * Maybe you can jump yourself in the pit for risk/reward type of situation?
  * Maybe you collect the coins and throw them into pit to get something?
- Need to think about how to earn the power-ups

Power-ups:
----------
- Twisted Mirror (makes a copy of the player, shoots/moves in the opposite direction)
   * Maybe, if one of the clone days, you keep playing as the other one and don't die right away?
   * Or your mirror clone would be just "transparent" to attacks for some period of time?
- Invisibility Cloak (you can pass through enemies and keep shooting)
- Berserk (like in Doom, you punch poor fucks with a single hit to death with fists)
   * Would be cool to make the player completely red with glowing yellow eyes and smoke coming out of his ears or something
- Ice Boots (leave a trail of icecyles damaging/slowing enemies)
   * Don't seem to be very useful compared to other power-ups
- Stomp Boots

Weapons:
--------
- Repeater crossbow (rapid fire, but lower damage)
- Throwing knives/axe (slower, but higher damage)
- Magic Wand (shooting fireballs, explosion AOE)
- Hammer? (high damage to enemies in front, others are stunned/slowed down)
- Fire bomb (AOE, low damage and enemies are slowed down)
- Spike trap (like a mine, shoots spikes up, kills a single enemy, up to N times before destruction)
